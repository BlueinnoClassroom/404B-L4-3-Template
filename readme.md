# 404B Lesson 4 Class Project - Activity Suggestions

## Instructions

### Split VS Code Window

You can drag `main.py` tab to the right side of the window to split the window into two panes. This will allow you to see the instructions and the code at the same time.

### Answering

You can answer the questions by writing your answers in the `main.py` file.

You can run the code by clicking the `Run` button on the top right corner of the editor.

The output will be shown in the `Terminal` tab at the bottom of the editor.

## Before We Start

### Bored API

We will be using a free web service (API) that provides random activity suggestion for bored people.

For example, visiting this link: <http://www.boredapi.com/api/activity/>,
you should see similar response like:

```json
{
    "activity":"Invite some friends over for a game night",
    "type":"social",
    "participants":4,
    "price":0,
    "link":"",
    "key":"6613428",
    "accessibility":0.2
}
```

We can also specify the type of activity in the link: <http://www.boredapi.com/api/activity?type=recreational>.

Should give you response of type `recreational` only:

```json
{
    "activity":"Do a jigsaw puzzle",
    "type":"recreational",
    "participants":1,
    "price":0.1,
    "link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_puzzle",
    "key":"8550768",
    "accessibility":1
}
```

You may explore more in the documentation: <https://www.boredapi.com/documentation>.

As you explored this API, you should have noticed the response format is a lot like the dictionary format in Python. This is a very common format used in data transfer between web/app and server.

## To Get Started

Run the following command in the terminal to install required libraries:

for Mac:

```bash
pip3 install requests
pip3 install pprint
```

for Windows/Linux:

```bash
pip install requests
pip install pprint
```

## Your Task

Write a program that accepts user input and provide random activity suggestion base on that input. The response should be printed in a readable format.

### Sample Input

```diff
